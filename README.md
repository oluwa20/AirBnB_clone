# Airbnb Console Application

This project is a console-based implementation of a simplified version of Airbnb, a vacation rental platform. It allows users to interact with the application through a command-line interface (CLI), enabling functionalities such as listing properties, searching for accommodations, making bookings, and managing reservations.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Airbnb application. Users can input commands to perform various actions, such as creating listings, searching for properties, and managing bookings. The interpreter parses user input, executes corresponding functions, and provides feedback or results to the user via the console.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core language used for development.
- **unittest**: Python's built-in testing framework for writing and running tests.
- **uuid**: Python's `uuid` module for generating universally unique identifiers.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Python and required dependencies.
3. Run the command interpreter script (`airbnb_console.py`) to start interacting with the application.

## Testing

The project includes a suite of unit tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the codebase. Run the tests using the `unittest` framework to verify that the application functions as intended.
